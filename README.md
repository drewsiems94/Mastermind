# Mastermind

This project is part of the The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum.

The goal was to build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code randomly generated by the computer, or you generate the secret code and allow the computer to to guess.

For the computer's guesses, I used the Swaszek Strategy wherein potential codes are eliminated from a list of all possible codes based on the clues provided.
